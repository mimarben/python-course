Using Python Turtle, build a clone of the 80s hit game Breakout.

Breakout was a hit game originally coded up by Steve Wozniak before he and Jobs started Apple. It's a simple game that is similar to Pong where you use a ball and paddle to break down a wall.

A good starting point is to review the lessons on Day 22 when we built the Pong game. But you will have plenty of things to Google, figure out and struggle through to complete this project. Try to avoid going to a tutorial on how to build breakout, instead spec out the project, figure out how it's going to work. Write down a checklist of todos and draw out a flow chart (if it helps).
