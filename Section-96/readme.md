Build a custom website using an API that you find interesting.


Using what you have learnt about HTTP request and REST APIs, in today's project you will build a website that uses data from a public API.

For example, previously we create a rain alert app using a weather API. We also created an ISS tracker and looking into Bitcoin prices, all using a public API.

Today, you get to work on an API that you find interesting and build a service or website based on that API.

Here are some example APIs:

New York Subway Data http://nycpulse.herokuapp.com/api

Elephant Data https://elephant-api.herokuapp.com/?ref=public-apis

Barcode Generator/Recognition https://www.cloudmersive.com/barcode-api?ref=public-apis

Stock Market Data https://marketstack.com/

Harry Potter Data https://www.potterapi.com/?ref=public-apis
 
Art Data

Dictionary API

ESPN Data http://www.espn.com/apis/devcenter/io-docs.html?ref=public-apis

Food Facts API

Brewery Data

Spelling and Grammar Check API

Sound Effects API

Lord of the Rings API
