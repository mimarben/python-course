# Day 63 Goals: Creating a Virtual Bookshelf

Have you ever wanted to keep track of the books you have read and give each book a rating?

This is not a new concept and there are plenty of companies that have built something for exactly this purpose.

e.g. https://www.librarything.com/

But in order to do this, we will need to learn how to use a database. By the end of today, you will have learnt how to create an SQLite database and how to create, read, update and delete data in the database.

We'll also be hooking up our database with a Flask application to serve data whenever needed.

So buckle up and head over to the next lesson!
